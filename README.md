## Table and API Changes

### 1. Custom Stages for Boards

If users are allowed to create and edit stages for a particular board, the following changes might be necessary:

#### Tables:
- *BoardStages Table:*
  - Add a new table to store custom stages for each board.
  - Fields: boardId, stageOrder, stageName, etc.

#### API Endpoints:
- *Create Custom Stage:*
  - Endpoint: /api/boards/:boardId/stages
  - Method: POST
  - Parameters: { stageName, stageOrder }
  
- *Update Custom Stage:*
  - Endpoint: /api/boards/:boardId/stages/:stageId
  - Method: PUT
  - Parameters: { stageName, stageOrder }

### 2. Task Comments

If users can comment on tasks, additional tables and API endpoints are needed:

#### Tables:
- *TaskComments Table:*
  - Add a new table to store comments related to tasks.
  - Fields: commentId, taskId, userId, commentText, timestamp, etc.

#### API Endpoints:
- *Create Task Comment:*
  - Endpoint: /api/tasks/:taskId/comments
  - Method: POST
  - Parameters: { userId, commentText }

## Error Handling

To handle errors in the API, consider implementing the following strategies:

- *Consistent Error Responses:*
  - Ensure that error responses follow a consistent format to make it easier for clients to handle them.

- *HTTP Status Codes:*
  - Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

- *Error Messages:*
  - Include meaningful error messages in the response payload to help developers identify and resolve issues.

- *Logging:*
  - Implement logging mechanisms to capture errors for debugging purposes.

- *Rate Limiting:*
  - Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse and to ensure fair usage of the API.

- *Authentication and Authorization Errors:*
  - Clearly distinguish between authentication errors and authorization errors to provide specific guidance to users.

- *Monitoring:*
  - Set up monitoring tools to receive alerts for critical errors, ensuring quick response and resolution.
